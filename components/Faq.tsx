      title: 'What does a BTC-backed economy mean and why is it important?',
      content: 'To be very simple, what we call a BTC-backed economy is similar to what a gold-backed currency was in the past. This means that besides all of the in-game use cases of our in-game currency Galactic Berry ($GB), it will also be exchangeable against BTC, in the future, from a BTC reserve created for and with the game economy. This is completely revolutionary in the Web 3 gaming space because until now most of the other Web 3 in-game currencies ended up, intentionally or not, having a Ponzi-like effect that affected the majority of users. With our brand new model, we should be able to avoid that kind of outcome and build a sustainable game economy and thus perhaps an enjoyable and profitable game.'

      title: 'What are shared sink utilities and how do they benefit Genesis Holders?',
      content: "Shared sink utilities are the name we have given to in-game utilities that will make our different collectible gaming assets effectively share the game's success. Basically, instead of having every game sink (what players spend their in-game currencies on) be fully owned by the game team, some major game sink will be shared with Genesis holders. For example, to breed, Genesis Conquerors will need Genesis Conqueror Lineage Factor (GCLF) from a male conqueror and a female conqueror. These GCLFs can only be produced by Genesis Conquerors and must be bought from them."

Modality might change to favor the most faithful holders but in any case, these two next collections will be free.'
